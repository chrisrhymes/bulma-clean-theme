Customer wants to keep this data for longer duration. This data can be used for analysis and compliance purpose. In NewIT innovation has more importance over the cost, but the same time customer need cost effective options.

## **Attribute consideration**

To manage costs for your expanding storage needs, it's helpful to organize your data based on attributes like frequency-of-access and planned retention period to optimize costs. Data stored in the cloud can be different in terms of how it is generated, processed, and accessed over its lifetime. Some data is actively accessed and modified throughout its lifetime. Some data is accessed frequently early in its lifetime, with access dropping drastically as the data ages. Some data remains idle in the cloud and is rarely, if ever, accessed once stored.
