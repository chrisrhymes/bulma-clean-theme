Microsoft recently announce the **ability to enable backup on virtual machines from VM create experience in the portal**.

Azure Backup supports backup of wide variety of VMs offered by Azure including Windows or Linux, VMs on managed or unmanaged disks, premium or standard storage, encrypted or non-encrypted VMs, or a combination of the above.

## Benefits of Azure VM backup

Azure VM backup provides following benefits using cloud-first approach to backup:

*   **Freedom from infrastructure**: No need to deploy any additional infrastructure to backup VMs.

*   **Application consistent backup**: Customers get application consistent backup for both Windows and Linux without the need to shutdown the virtual machine.

*   **Instant-file recovery**: With instant-file recovery, you can browse files and folders inside the VM, and recover only required files without the need to restore entire virtual machine.

*   **Pay as you go**: Simple Backup pricing makes it easy to protect VMs and pay for what you use.

## How to configure

It's same experience the way you create VM. Go to settings, you will find backup option.

**Select or create a vault in-line**: Customers have a choice for vault â€“ select an existing one or create a new one to store backups. To support customer configurations where they want to store backups and VMs in different resource groups, we also support creating vault in a different resource group other than the VM.

**Manage backup policy for the VM**: Customers can create a new backup policy and use this policy to configure backup on the virtual machine, all from the VM create experience. This policy also supports enterprise level GFS schema for flexible retention choices for backups.
