 ## New Azure Free Account

Earlier when we sign up for Azure free account, we use to get 30 days free account with $200 credit. So, if you consume all $200 or 30 days, either you need to upgrade your account or it got disabled. Microsoft recently launch New Azure Free Account. The Azure free account includes $200 credit to spend for 30 days and free Azure products for 12 months. In addition to this it also give  25+ always free services
<!--more-->
*   Services can be created in any region
*   Multiple instances of services can be created within allowed limits
 

The good thing is here that Azure keeps track of your usage of each service and doesnâ€™t charge you unless you exceed the limits. Within these limits, Azure free account provides you the flexibility to use various service configurations to meet your needs.
